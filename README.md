# Fa√ßade Pattern

This pattern gives the client a simple and straightforward way to use a subsystem, encapsulating all the logic behind a simple and flexible implementation. But the client still able to use the subsystem directly without using the facade implementation.

## The study cases

### Handling Game Settings

This project gives you an example of how to implement this pattern in Java, considering the scenario of initializing a virtual game and its settings. You can start several games with different kinds and facade implementations.

The project also provides a quick view from a scenario that does not use the pattern, given too much responsibility to the client while handling all the components initialization and their dependencies.
